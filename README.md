# Example code for extending and controlling the VeriStand Editor.

We provide two example VeriStand Screen controls and supporting documentation to show how you could add your own controls to VeriStand.

# Getting Started

## Installing

Clone or download this repo.

## Dependencies
* .NET - VeriStand is built against .NET 4.6.2, which you will need installed on your local machine.
* Compiler - This example was created with Visual Studio 2015, but any C# editor and compiler should work as long as they support .NET 4.6.2.

## Usage

To run, simply set VeriStand as your debug executable and run the project. You should see a new palette in your screen document with two droppable controls.

## Architecture
Please read the [architecture page](VeriStandCustomControls/ARCHITECTURE.md) for details on the code provided.

## Assistance

This code is provided as is. VeriStand R&D will provide some help getting started/answering questions but support will be limited. Feel free to submit issues or documentation/example requests.
